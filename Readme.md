# Assignment

To open scenes use 1,2,3,4 buttons.

Scenes with minimal pass tasks are under buttons 1, 2, 3. To see task for extra grade press 4.

In scene 1 and 4 some objects can be moved (teapot in scene 1 and troll in scene 4). To move them use buttons u,i,o,j,k,l for rottation and "," and "." for movement.

## Extra grade
For extra grade these things were implemented:
1. OOP structure of the project
2. Normal mapping
3. Parallax mapping
4. Portal
5. Mirror (atleast attempt, because I don't know how to create true mirror without ray tracing, and I think it's not possible)
6. Cell mapping (cartoon style)
